I don't think I have any unique perspectives on organizing people. It is hard
work and the tools out there are never the best. Organizer is the particular
windmill I have decided to tilt at in response.

It is a work in progress. Small bits of hacking thrown around a django core and
postgres database. Expect bumps. Expect bugs. Expect my undying admiration and
love for your patch submissions and pull requests.
